\section Manifesto

I'd like to write a manifesto stating my intentions about Hypnos' project.
Hypnos will never be the fastest UO emulator (such an emulator would have to
be written entirely in C++) nor the most scriptable (which may be Luxor's MyUO,
which supports packet forging and database access via script) but it has a
clear purpose in my opinions.

Hypnos must be simple. I want to create an emulator combining Sphere's
simplicity with NoX-Wizard's 'wannabe' power.

ID-defined objects (legacy from UOX/Wolfpack), numerical ID assigned to script
definitions must disappear. ".go" command and regions managed as in Sphere, and
so on. Unicorn (obviously reconfigured for Hypnos on release 1.0) is already
similar to Axis, and will be even more so when EVERY object will be
categorized, and for this I'll need much 'manpower'.

In addiction a default behaviour should be defined, suited for quick needs so,
like in Sphere, you won't go crazy trying to set up a minimal shard.

I'm displeased about the fact that removing non-id-scripted objects, tools like
Xuri's Worldbuilder won't work anymore, but we can live without it.

Another important feature will be independence from scripting language. I want
to use scripts written in different languages just changing a shared library
(.so in linux, .dll in windows) and configuration settings.

What I want won't be easily realized, and for most of the hard work I have to
thank Chrono and Ghisha, valid collegues which I hope to work with for a long
time, all of this wouldn't had be possible without them.

Also thanks to Judas for translating this text from italian to english :)
