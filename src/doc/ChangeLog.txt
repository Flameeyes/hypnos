Give a changelog for PyUO is a very complex operation. You probably prefer
to access to cvsweb and take a look to revisions.
This file was here in the NoX-Wizard distribution so I wanted to give you
a look to what we have changed from original NoX-Wizard emulator.

- First, and most important, thing is that we don't use AMX or Small as
  scripting language. Instead we use Python scripts.
- PyUO doesn't have a GUI neither under windows, should be run in production
  shards as a daemon (we still miss the code, but we'll fix this ASAP).
- Support for BeOS is dropped right now (sorry, but we need a lot of work to
  make it works under BeOS, and now we can't. If you use BeOS and can make a
  non-intrusive patch to PyUO to support it, you're wellcome).
- Windows supported compiler is mingw32
