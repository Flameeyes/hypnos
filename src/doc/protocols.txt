Sometimes in the documentation you find some brief with strange tags like
[UO4]. These are "notes" for the devel to know that the variable, the
function or whatever is for only one UO-Protocol version.

[UO3] Represent Ultima Online: The Third Age (3D client) specific variables.

[UO4] Represent Ultima Online: Age of Shadows specific variables, functions
      and so on.

These function need to be identified becase we can find why a function
isn't called in some clients or servers.
