This temporary directory is used to case-study the possibility to auto-generate
the settings-handling code at build time, using a simple python script.

The setdesc.xml file describes all the settings, naming, typing and givin an
help for them.

The setcompile.py script parses the setdesc.xml file and converts the .xml file
into autoset.cpp and autoset.h files.
